# 🌍 Top Countries for Climate Adaptability, Education, & Cost of Living

## 📌 Project Overview
This project ranks countries based on their climate readiness, economic capacity, governance, health risks, higher education quality, and cost of living. The ranking is inspired by the ND-GAIN Index, which measures a country's ability to adapt to climate change.

Through data cleaning, standardization, and composite scoring, this analysis determines which countries provide the best balance of climate resilience, economic stability, and affordability—with the United Kingdom emerging as the top choice!

## 🏗️ Ranking Methodology
Countries were ranked based on a composite score derived from two key indices:

1️⃣ Readiness Rank (Positive Factors)

Current Climate Readiness
Economic Capacity
Government Stability
Higher Education Quality
2️⃣ Vulnerability Rank (Negative Factors)

Health Risks
Cost of Living
Fresh Water Availability
Arable Land Availability
📊 Final Composite Score Calculation:
Readiness Rank - Vulnerability Rank = Composite Score
Higher scores indicate countries that are well-prepared for climate change while offering economic stability and livability.

🔍 Key Findings

The United Kingdom ranks #1 due to strong governance, top-tier education, and a balanced cost of living.
Countries with high economic capacity & government stability generally rank higher.
Affordable cost of living significantly impacts country rankings, as seen in adjusted composite scores.
